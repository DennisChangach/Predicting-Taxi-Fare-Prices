# Predicting Taxi Fare Prices
This repository implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting taxi fares using a modular approach. The project is divided into well-defined components focusing on specific tasks, promoting reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Features:

- Modular Design: The code is organized into modules for data ingestion, preparation, transformation, model training, and utilities.
- Data Pipelines: Components are chained together using pipelines for efficient data processing workflows.
- Taxi Fare Prediction: Predicts taxi fares based on historical data.
